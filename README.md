# Alternate-take-Halo-5

I am taking lessons from Codecademy and posting them here.
This is my first piece that I felt that I could call my own work, and not just a learning process.
It is a text adventure where you play as Spartan Locke during the events of Halo 5.
You control his actions and can come to a different outcome than that of the game itself, or you can
just get the same ending. I took liberties to try and add character to Locke, but I know my
opinions are just mine. If you find anything wrong I would love to know. If you take the time to play it
thank you. It is greatly appreciated. Please have fun and a wonderful day!
